# Data_Analysis_Projects
This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my ability to execute the full data analysis lifecycle. Each project includes data cleaning, transformation, and Exploratory Data Analysis. Key skills demonstrated across these projects include Pandas operations, statistical modeling, and creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Libraries

* **Python** 
* **Pandas** 
* **NumPy**    
* **Matplotlib**  
* **Seaborn**   


## Setup and Requirements

To run the analysis for any project locally, you will need:
1.  **Python 3.x**
2.  **Required Libraries:** Install the necessary packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Data:** Each project's local `README.md` will specify where to download the required dataset.
